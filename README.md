# python-barzahlen
Just a barzahlen python wrapper with a simple api and pretty much the same interface like the PHP Barzahlen SDK

If you don't want to use the simple api that is currently untested, take a look at the [PHP SDK](https://github.com/Barzahlen/Barzahlen-PHP) it is the same structure even the method names are cemal case
